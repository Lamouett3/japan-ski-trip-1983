You will discover the majestic Sens\u014d-ji temple, the city's oldest, famous for its Kaminarimon gate and five-storey pagoda. The spiritual atmosphere here contrasts with the lively Nakamise street, lined with small craft shops and local food stalls.",
    "p2": "The morning continues with a visit to the Tsukiji market, long considered one of the world's largest fish markets. Japanese gastronomy comes to life here: colourful stalls, freshly caught fish and an authentic atmosphere. Instead of a conventional breakfast, you will enjoy a street-food style lunch on site — the perfect opportunity to taste sushi, sashimi, skewers and other local specialties.",
    "p3": "In the afternoon head to Ginza, nicknamed Tokyo's Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. This chic and sophisticated district mixes modern architecture, department stores, luxury boutiques and galleries, offering a refined side of the capital.",
    "p4": "The day ends in one of contemporary Japan's most emblematic places: Shibuya. Experience the famous Shibuya Crossing in person — the world's busiest pedestrian intersection. Between glittering neon signs, giant screens and the flow of people, this place perfectly captures Tokyo's energy."
